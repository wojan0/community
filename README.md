This repository contains no code, but hosts the LTSP community [discussions](https://github.com/ltsp/community/issues) and [wiki](https://github.com/ltsp/community/wiki). LTSP users and developers participate in those and some also hangout in the [#ltsp IRC channel](http://ts.sch.gr/repo/irc).

# LTSP upstream

LTSP developers maintain the LTSP [website](https://ltsp.org) with the [core documentation](https://ltsp.org/docs/), [man pages](https://ltsp.org/man/) and [installation instructions](https://ltsp.org/docs/installation). You may report LTSP bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ltsp/ltsp/issues).

# LTSP 5 resources

LTSP 5 was the the old, unmaintained version that was rewritten from scratch in 2019. Some resources about it may still be found in its [mailing lists](https://sourceforge.net/p/ltsp/mailman/), the deprecated [Ubuntu wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP) and its launchpad [project page](https://launchpad.net/ltsp).
